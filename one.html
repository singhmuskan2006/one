		<h2>Sky...</h2>
		<p>
			I'm that girl that gets really excited when the sky is in pretty colors. That's why every evening around 6, I go out to my terrace and try and capture these beautiful phenomenal colours. 
			And how I capture these colours in my mind aren't limited to the sky, it goes beyond that.

		<h2>Clouds...</h2>
		<p> Massive amounts of wind are both music and the dance-floor for the clouds... vagrant, white and puffy as they are - playing and teasing with other clouds and moving freely in the sky as if they own freedom itself. Yet I wondered why at times they cry with fierce and sonorous thunder...</p>

		<h2>Sunset...</h2>
		<p>
			Dusk is just an illusion because the sun is either above the horizon or below it. And that means that day and night are linked in a way that few things are there cannot be one without the other yet they cannot exist at the same time. How would it feel I remember wondering to be always together yet forever apart?
